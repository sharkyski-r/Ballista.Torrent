# lexitize app repair

I spent more time looking at this that most prospective buyers than most if I were to look at analytics but this is just my opinion and based on what I have seen lately among web page design in general.
  
 My intent is not to speak negatively about an app or work done creating an app but it's just an opinion and helpful nudge.
 
 This app looks promising but I've never seen something so jumbled up. This may be due to my mobile phone not assembling the parts correctly but in each section appears half of the bullets are FAQ and half correctly sorted by function  

 There is no section for how much premium cost or how to pay   

 There is no "about the developer section"  or how the app came to be . Most apps today solve a problem that the old way is no good and raising the need for an app. the later pic had text stacked on top of other text.
 
 A proper contact us button not present  either 

 Also the app will not let me copy and paste the API dictionary to the page or activate the enable key button. The enable page will not accept a typed API Key or activte the check API button 

my device is Android Google Pixel 3a
