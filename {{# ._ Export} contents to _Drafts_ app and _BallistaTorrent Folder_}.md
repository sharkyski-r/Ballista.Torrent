# {{# .: Export} contents to *Drafts* app and *BallistaTorrent Folder*}

+[<git journal> {# .: Export} contents to Drafts, iOS notes sharkyski.bt@tutanota.com]

[# BallistaTorrent Folder] is a methodology for capturing, filing, and annotating notes/data digitally that can be folded or unfolded, expanded or collapsed, overlaid, abstracted obstructed as needed by the user.

 The main idea is to string as much information as possible in the shortest form yet readable to intermediates 

The problem - Im running into is wasting time backtracking to find good search resources, references, locations of files, names and titles used, logins, trade names, aliases etc.
 I would like to have much of what I need to know at a glance similar to how stock market analysts use ichimochu clouds on charts to quickly forecast trend and "average pace".
 Most recently a new problem is, as a need arises with annotation, when I find a decent method like markdown, I always find a new better version that paints a better picture, or I come up with a scheme that is similar to something that already exists and is something I should have learned along time ago. This is frustrating and enlightening to me because I can imagine how to apply those newly discovered systems that I can take basically into other fields.
